The Kidney Care

Kidney Anatomy
Know about different functions of a Kidney.

The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs on either side of your spine, below your ribs and behind your belly. Each kidney is about 4 or 5 inches long, roughly the size of a large fist.
The kidneys' job is to filter your blood. They remove wastes, control the body's fluid balance, and keep the right levels of electrolytes. All of the blood in your body passes through them several times a day.
Blood comes into the kidney, waste gets removed, and salt, water, and minerals are adjusted, if needed. The filtered blood goes back into the body. Waste gets turned into urine, which collects in the kidney's pelvis -- a funnel-shaped structure that drains down a tube called the ureter to the bladder.
Each kidney has around a million tiny filters called nephrons. You could have only 10% of your kidneys working, and you may not notice any symptoms or problems.
If blood stops flowing into a kidney, part or all of it could die. That can lead to kidney failure.



Different Parts of a Kidney.

 
There are three major regions of the kidney: 
Renal cortex. The kidneys are surrounded by a renal cortex, a layer of tissue that is also covered by renal fascia (connective tissue) and the renal capsule. The renal cortex is granular tissue due to the presence of nephrons—the functional unit of the kidney—that are located deeper within the kidney, within the renal pyramids of the medulla. 
Renal medulla. The medulla is the inner region of the parenchyma of the kidney. The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses, called the renal pyramids, which are triangle structures that contain a dense network of nephrons.
Renal pelvis. The renal pelvis contains the hilum. The hilum is the concave part of the bean-shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney; it is also the point of exit for the ureters—the urine-bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder. The renal pelvis connects the kidney to the rest of the body.

Functions Of A Kidney

Regulation of extracellular fluid volume. The kidneys work to ensure an adequate quantity of plasma to keep blood flowing to vital organs.
 Regulation of osmolarity. The kidneys help keep extracellular fluid from becoming too dilute or concentrated with respect to the solutes carried in the fluid.
 Regulation of ion concentrations. The kidneys are responsible for maintaining relatively constant levels of key ions including sodium, potassium and calcium.
 Regulation of pH. The kidneys prevent blood plasma from becoming too acidic or basic by regulating ions.
 Excretion of wastes and toxins. The kidneys filter out a variety of water-soluble waste products and environmental toxins into the urine for excretion.
 Production of hormones. The kidneys produce erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell synthesis, and renin, which helps control salt and water balance and blood pressure. They are also involved in regulating plasma calcium and glucose levels.

Kidney Diseases

Types of Kidney Diseases
Kidney Stones
Kidney Cancer
Hydronephrosis
Nephrotic Syndrome
Polycystic Kidney
ESRD - Dialysis HD, PD
CKD
 
Diagnosis
Blood tests. Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood.
Urine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease.
Imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys' structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases.
Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue. Kidney biopsy is often done with local anesthesia using a long, thin needle that's inserted through your skin and into your kidney. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing to help determine what's causing your kidney problem.

Treatment Options

Hemodialysis 
It uses a machine to move your blood through a filter outside your body, removing wastes.
Peritoneal dialysis
It uses the lining of your belly to filter your blood inside your body, removing wastes. 
Conservative management 
It treats kidney failure without dialysis or a transplant. You’ll work with your health care team to manage symptoms and preserve your kidney function and quality of life as long as possible.


Kidney Transplant.
Kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from a person who has just died, or from a living person, into your body to filter your blood.
Q. Who should go for a transplant?
A. The basic criteria for kidney transplant selection include the presence of irreversible kidney failure. Any adult or child who has been diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can be considered for transplant evaluation.
Q. What hospitals provide transplant facilities?
A.
Q. What are the precautions before and after a kidney transplant?
A. 
 Avoid infections. …
Stay hydrated. ...
Don't eat raw or under-cooked foods. ...
Focus on protein. ...
Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice. ...
Don't take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). ...
Skip on antihistamines and antacids. ...
Avoid certain vitamins and herbal supplements.

Research and Innovation Kidney diseases
3D Kidney
Regenerative medicine is said to be advancing thanks to new manufacturing techniques, including 3D printing. Bioprinting, in a few words, is the utilization of layer-by-layer fabrication techniques to combine cells and biomaterials to produce organic-like parts that function.
 
 
Bio-Artificial Kidney

The bioartificial kidney is a compact, surgically implanted, free-standing device to treat end stage renal disease (ESRD). It performs the vast majority of the biological functions of the natural kidney.
